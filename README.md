# sample-code

Hello!

I'm relatively new to GitHub, but I'm glad you found my sample code. This is a script I made to assist in taking attendance as a graduate teaching assistant. It ultimately was used for all nine of the online recitations our staff facilitated. I am unable to provide the corresponding data files, since they primarily consisted of personal identifying information about the students I taught. Let me know if I can answer any questions; my email is ehmcke.2@osu.edu.
